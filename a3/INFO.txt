In ext2_ls.c, it works ok if the path is in the current directory. 
But if I excute ext2_mkdir and create a new directory and excute ext2_ls in given path ./createdDir,
then it will go into infinte loop. 

In ext2_rm_bonus.c, I tried to use recursion to remove all the file in the given dir. But at the end,
the function is not working.
